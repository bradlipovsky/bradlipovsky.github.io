The environmental geophysics and computation research group in the [Department of Earth and Space Sciences](http://ess.uw.edu) at the [University of Washington](http://washington.edu) is lead by [Brad Lipovsky](https://www.ess.washington.edu/people/profile.php?pid=lipovsky--brad). Learn more about our [group vision](https://github.com/bradlipovsky/group-vision/blob/main/group-vision.md).  

**Open positions** in our group are listed [here](hiring.md).

We study a wide range of environemental systems with an eye towards the unique ability of academic research to benefit humanity through fundamental research.  Recent areas of interest include,

* __Ice shelf fracture__ and its relationship to marine ice sheet stability
* Geophysical, and particularly seismic, observations of __glacier sliding__
* __Hydraulic fracturing__ in volcanoes, glaciers, and reservoirs
* __Landslide physics__, seismicity, and early warning
* __Tectonic earthquake__ complexity and interaction with the fluid Earth
* __Subsea hydroacoustic wave propagation__
* Novel measurements of __volcanic unrest__

Methodologically, optical fiber geophysics is a major focus of our group. We are interested in Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) as well as other technologies.  Our group runs the University of Washington [Photonic Sensing Facility](http://psf.uw.edu).
