An introduction graduate course that explores the physics of glaciers and ice sheets


## Description
This course explores the physics of glaciers and ice sheets. We begin by describing
“synoptic scale” glaciology, i.e., at the scale of entire glaciers and ice sheets. The course then
examines the smaller-scale physics of the glacier-atmosphere, -bed, and -ocean interfaces, the
interactions between ice sheets and planetary climates, and the analysis of ice cores. Special
attention will be given to a dozen or so deep-focus topics that may include ice shelf hydraulic
fracturing, glacier sliding, the marine ice sheet instability, climatic forcing of ice sheet steady
states, and ice core reconstructions. These topics will be approached using mathematical
physics, geophysical data, simple computer simulations, and large-scale ice sheet models.
Prerequisites. Familiarity with the analysis of partial differential equations. Matlab will be used
throughout this course.

## Course outline 
(approximately by week number)

1. Synoptic scale glaciology 1: observations of modern glaciers and ice sheets. Geophysical
and remotely sensed observations. The geological record of past ice sheets.
2. Synoptic scale glaciology 2: glaciers and ice sheets as thin diffusive flows. Stokes flow,
ice constitutive relations, asymptotic approximations to ice flow including the shallow
ice approximation. Simple ice sheet models as a framework for hypothesis testing.
Flow energetics. The time scales of glacier response.
3. The glacier-atmosphere interface: mass and energy balances. Components of the SMB
and SEB. Temperature-melt relationships. Firn compaction. Ice sheet topographic
feedbacks. Why do Martian ice sheets appear so different from those on Earth?
4. The glacier-bed interface 1: basal sliding. The classical theory of glacier sliding. Bed
plasticity and ice streams.
5. The glacier-bed interface 2: glacier hydrology. Simple models of the components of the
glacier hydrological system. Glacier outburst flooding. Subglacial lakes. Interfacial
chemistry and subglacial effective pressure.
6. The ice-ocean interface 1: ice shelves and the shallow shelf approximation. Grounding
line position, glacial isostatic adjustment, and the marine ice sheet instability.
7. The ice-ocean interface 2: ice shelf buttressing, the spectrum of glacier calving behavior,
basal mass balance, tidewater glaciers. Ice shelf hydraulic fracture.
8. Ice and climate 1: Ice sheet steady states. The global temperature-ice-albedo feedback.
Mechanical analysis of ice flow on Snowball Earth and Europa.
9. Ice and climate 2: The Quaternary ice sheets. The Last Glacial Maximum. Heinrich
Events. Outbursts floods and their impact on climate.
10. Ice and climate 3: Contemporary changes. Minimal glacier models and the record of
glacier length changes. Current evolution of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.
Attribution of certain changes to human activity (or not).
11. Ice core studies. Age-Depth relations. Temperature and accumulation reconstructions.
Stable isotopes, fractionation. Ice core disturbances due to interfacial premelting.
12. Final presentations.

## Problem sets
There will be several problem sets. Collaboration is encouraged.

## Class Meetings
Meetings will be a mixture of traditional lectures as well as problem solving
time. During problem solving sessions students will do a combination of math, programming,
and data analysis surrounding the weekly deep-focus topic.

## Final Project 
Students will work alone or in groups to answer a glaciological research question
that they formulate with the assistance of the Instructor. It’s recommended that students
begin to formulate their research question by visiting office hours throughout the term. The
final project will consist of 1) a written report of about the length of a paper in Geophysical
Research Letters, 2) an open repository of any codes developed for the project, and 3) a 15-
minute “AGU” style talk.

## Grading 
50% Problem Sets, 50% Final Project.

## The Harvard Honor Code
“Members of the Harvard College community commit themselves to
producing academic work of integrity – that is, work that adheres to the scholarly and
intellectual standards of accurate attribution of sources, appropriate collection and use of data,
and transparent acknowledgement of the contribution of others to their ideas, discoveries,
interpretations, and conclusions. Cheating on exams or problem sets, plagiarizing or
misrepresenting the ideas or language of someone else as one’s own, falsifying data, or any
other instance of academic dishonesty violates the standards of our community, as well as the
standards of the wider world of learning and affairs.”

## Academic Accommodations
Any student needing academic adjustments or accommodations
is requested to speak with the Lecturer by the end of the second week of the term.
