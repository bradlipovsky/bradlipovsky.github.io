Floating ice shelves exert a net buttressing force on grounded ice and therefore support the stability of ice sheets.  The extent of ice shelves is often limited by the formation of 10~to~100~km long, through-thickness fractures called rifts.  Rifts tend to grow in length until they connect to the ice front and create a tabular iceberg.
