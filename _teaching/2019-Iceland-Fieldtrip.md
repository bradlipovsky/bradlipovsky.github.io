# Logistics

## Lodging
We will be staying at Hostel style accommodations.  Typically there are rooms with 3-four beds (possibly bunk beds), assigned by gender.  Bathrooms and showers are “down the hall”.    You might want to pack a light bath robe and slippers. Before the trip we will give you a list of the places we will be staying along with contact information.

## Meals
Let us know if you have any dietary restrictions.  Meals will be taken care of and we will supply some snacks.  Breakfast in Iceland is typically a smorgasbord, that includes hard-boiled eggs, cheese, ham, fruit, various breads and crackers, and usually cold cereals, oatmeal, and the Iceland yogurt called skyr.  Sometimes we will make our lunch from this spread, sometimes box lunches will be provided.  Dinners will typically be set menus, with provision for vegetarians and vegans.  You should expect to be served a lot of fish and lamb.  

## Washing clothes
Don’t plan on it.  Opportunities for washing will be limited.  You should bring what you need. 

## Weather
The weather in Iceland is typically windy, wet and cool.   Be prepared!  Bring all the suggested clothing on the gear list.  Jacket and rain pants are essential;  they don’t need to be high tech (expensive) breathable fabric.  Bring bathing suits  for the hot springs!  Sturdy hiking boots are required.  Both moraines and lava flows can be uneven and unstable.  

## Hikes
The hikes will be generally less than an hour, but we will have one day with longer hikes.  We will probably have a long and short option, but the hikes will be half day. Trails will be similar to what you might expect in the US with some rocky and wet stretches and some steep sections.

## Travel by bus
We will have one large bus.  We will generally stop at least once every two hours at a place with toilettes and a store.  These facilities have Wifi, as will our lodgings.  Pack light! We will be changing our lodgings almost every night, and dragging huge suitcases or duffels is tiresome, and space is limited on the bus.  



Gear List
==========
tl;dr: For this trip to Iceland, you will not need “evening out” types of clothes, lots of shoes, etc. However, you should be prepared for wet and cool to cold weather and intermittent intense sun. Temperatures will typically be in the 40’s to 50’s °F with below freezing temperatures possible.  We will get out for geology stops, often requiring short hikes, regardless of the of weather conditions that we may encounter. We will also do some longer hikes/ excursions so good boots, and adequate rain/snow gear are essential. 

- Day pack, large enough for lunch, rain gear, water bottle, sweater
- Notebook for journal entries
- Passport, visa, airline tickets (provided), and other travel documents, with backup copies
- Pens and pencils; some color pencils would be useful
- Camera, charger, plug adapter, extra batteries
- Smart phone (remember to bring power adapter for Iceland/Europe)
- Small flashlight (head lamps are great)
- Water bottle, one liter
- Toiletries (toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, hair brush, deodorant, etc.)
- Swimsuit for hot springs
- Towel and washcloth for hostels and hot springs
- Sleepwear for hostels (including light bathrobe, flip-flops or slippers for shared bath accommodations down the hall)
- Medications (personal “life  support” supplies, and prescriptions)
- Medium weight hiking boots (really important to break them in if new!)
- Sneakers or light shoes (for evenings or in Reykjavik)
- Sunglasses; critical in the sub-arctic summer on snow, as is sunscreen, lip balm, etc.
- Sun hat, with visor (baseball caps work)
- Rain parka with hood and rain pants
- Warm gloves and warm hat (extras are good because one pair may get wet)
- Heavy sweater or fleece, or two lighter for layering
- Two pairs of long pants (zip-off combo pants/short are great if dorky)
- One pair of shorts (just in case!),
- Two or three long-sleeve shirts
- One short-sleeve shirt
- Sufficient T-shirts and underwear (there will be limited opportunities for laundry)
- Hiking and sneaker socks, multiple pairs
- Long underwear, bottoms and tops.

More info:  Layering is the key to comfort. Although several places where we will stay have laundry facilities, they are very slow so that you might have to team up and just wash essentials. Best plan is look at laundry as a luxury rather than essential.   You will be limited to one 50lb checked bag and one small carry on no more than 22lb, moreover space on the buss is limited and you will be handling these bags every day: DO NOT BRING TOO MUCH STUFF! Proper clothing and boots is mandatory
