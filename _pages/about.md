The environmental geophysics and computation research group in the [Department of Earth and Space Sciences](http://ess.uw.edu) at the [University of Washington](http://washington.edu) is lead by [Brad Lipovsky](https://www.ess.washington.edu/people/profile.php?pid=lipovsky--brad) .

**Our group is hiring.** If you're interested in undergraduate, graduate, or postdoctoral positions, [please reach out](mailto://bpl7@uw.edu).

We study a wide range of environemental systems with an eye towards the unique ability of academic research to benefit humanity through fundamental research.  Recent areas of interest include,

* __Ice shelf fracture__ and its relationship to marine ice sheet stability
* Geophysical, and particularly seismic, observations of __glacier sliding__
* __Hydraulic fracturing__ in volcanoes, glaciers, and reservoirs
* __Landslide physics__, seismicity, and early warning
* __Tectonic earthquake__ complexity and interaction with the fluid Earth
