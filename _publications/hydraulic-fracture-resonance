title: "Vibrational modes of hydraulic fractures: Inference of fracture
geometry from resonant frequencies and attenuation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/hydraulic-fracture-resonance
excerpt: 'Oscillatory seismic signals arising from resonant vibrations of hydraulic fractures are observed
in many geologic systems, including volcanoes, glaciers and ice sheets, and hydrocarbon and geothermal
reservoirs. To better quantify the physical dimensions of fluid-filled cracks and properties of the fluids within
them, we study wave motion along a thin hydraulic fracture waveguide.'
