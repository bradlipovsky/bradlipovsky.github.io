![Fracture stresses on the Amery Ice Shelf.](https://bradlipovsky.github.io/images/AmeryImage.gif)

__Starting in January 2021, I will be an assistant professor in the Department of Earth and Space Sciences at the University of Washington__

Whether estimating sea level rise due to ice sheet melting or forecasting  volcanic or tectonic unrest, the role of numerical simulations in our understanding of societally-relevant Earth system phenomena is fundamental. I use geophysical observations to validate the processes represented in these societally-relevant, physics-based models.  Such  models must reflect the real world; that is, they must be valid.  Yet strict model validation is not as common as it ought to be.  Validation is hard because it is interdisciplinary: it is the intersection of  data and models and of observation and theory.  My overarching goal --to consistently understand, observe, and model societally-relevant Earth system phenomena-- is documented in the scientific publications, teaching resources, and software presented on this website.

Several themes and highlights of my research program include: 

* I employ first-of-their kind models and new remote sensing and field strategies to understand __ice shelf fracture__ and its relationship to marine ice sheet stability.
* I interrogate the validity of assumptions in ice sheet models and their __glacier sliding laws__ using geophysical observations.
* I articulate a theory of __hydraulic fracturing__ in volcanoes, glaciers, and reservoirs based in asymptotic analysis, observation, and fieldwork.
* I shape an understanding of __landslide__ seismicity that may provide hazard early warning.
* I exploit geodesy, seismology, and rupture dynamical simulations to understand __tectonic earthquake__ complexity and post-seismic response.
