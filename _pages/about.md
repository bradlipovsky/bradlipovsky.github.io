The environmental geophysics and computation research group in the [Department of Earth and Space Sciences](http://ess.uw.edu) at the [University of Washington](http://washington.edu) is lead by [Brad Lipovsky](https://www.ess.washington.edu/people/profile.php?pid=lipovsky--brad). We study a wide range of environemental systems with an eye towards the unique ability of academic research to benefit humanity through fundamental research.  Learn more about our [group vision](https://github.com/bradlipovsky/group-vision/blob/main/group-vision.md).  (Publications below are referenced to Brad's CV.)

# Ice shelf fracture, calving, and stability
The floating ice shelves that surround the Antarctic Ice Sheet act like retaining walls that protect the grounded part of the ice sheet. The stability of the Antarctic ice shelves to fracturing is therefore a central topic when attempting to understand rates of future sea level rise.  Particular areas of interest include,
- The dynamics of hydraulic fractures in ice shelves and other systems (2)
- Ice shelf rift propagation, including the role of shear margins (13) and ocean water interactions (24)
- The first-ever study documenting the ice dynamics of the post-calving phase of the calving cycle (25)
- The effect of ocean swell (6,14), tides (18), and other environmental forcing in understanding ice shelf fracture

# Optical fiber sensing
Optical fiber sensing is a major focus of our group. We are interested in Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) as well as other technologies.  Our group runs the University of Washington [Fiber Lab](http://fiberlab.uw.edu).

# Glacier Dynamics 
- The relationship between glacier sliding and basal icequakes (3,10,16,19)
- Glacier slow slip events (5,15)
- Seismic observations of subglacial water flow (9)

# Other projects
Sometimes a project is just too interesting to say no, even if it doesn't draw a clear arc with other research.  We've published broadly on topics including landslides, tectonic earthquakes, volcanic activity, and ocean wave propagation.
