title: "Crack wave resonances within the basal water layer"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/crackwave-glacier-observation
excerpt: 'Subglacial hydrology exerts a significant control on glacier flow. Despite this importance, it is inherently difficult to observe processes at the glacier bed. Therefore numerous studies either concentrate on point measurements directly at the glacier bed through boreholes, or on recordings of signals emitted from hydraulic events acquired with passive seismic techniques. These recordings often show resonances, whose interpretation is challenging (Clarke, 2005; Podolskiy and Walter, 2016). Some studies attribute similar resonance observations in other geological contexts to an intrinsic resonance of hydraulic fractures (Aki and others, 1977) while other studies explain such observations as wave propagation effects (Bean and others, 2014). Here, we explore these mechanics using observations from a kHz-sampled pressure sensor installed in a borehole directly above the hard granite bedrock of a temperate mountain glacier in Switzerland.  Our borehole observations confirm the occurrence of both sound and crack waves within the basal water layer.'
