title: "Dynamics of the Askja caldera July 2014 landslide, Iceland, from seismic signal analysis: precursor, motion and aftermath"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/askja
excerpt: 'Landslide hazard motivates the need for a deeper understanding of the events that occur before, during, and after catastrophic slope failures.  Here, we use data from a network of 58 seismic stations to characterise a large landslide at the Askja caldera, Iceland, on 21 July 2014.'
