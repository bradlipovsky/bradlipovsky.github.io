A wide variety of processes occur when a glacier slides over bedrock or sediment.  These sliding interfaces are difficult places to directly observe, and for this reason much of my work in this area involves the use of microseismicity to infer subglacial conditions.  Several projects have specifically targeted sliding processes in the Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica ([Lipovsky and Dunham, 2016](http://bradlipovsky.github.io/files/LipovskyDunham2016.pdf), [Lipovsky and Dunham, 2017](http://bradlipovsky.github.io/files/LipovskyDunham2017.pdf)).
