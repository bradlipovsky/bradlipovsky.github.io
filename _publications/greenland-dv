title: "Monitoring southwest Greenland’s ice sheet melt with ambient seismic noise"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/greenland-dv
excerpt: 'The Greenland ice sheet presently accounts for ∼70% of global ice sheet mass loss.  We demonstrate that small variations in seismic wave speed in Earth’s crust, as measured with the correlation of seismic noise, may be used to infer seasonal ice sheet mass balance.'
